# SQL-restaurant-db
The aim of this project is to analyze restaurant operations data to evaluate the performance of a newly launched menu. Using menu and order data, the analysis identifies which items perform well or poorly and highlights customer preferences. The results support data-driven decisions around menu optimization and customer demand.
